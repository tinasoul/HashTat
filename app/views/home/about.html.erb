  <h1>BUILT BY</h1>
  <p>
      Three young women, Tina, Shannon, and Doa, who learned to code in 10 weeks without a lick of programming experience prior. Hashtat was born out of our pure love for art, story, and community. In supporting hashtat, you are also supporting the movement of women entering jobs in technology.</p>
      <p>We stand on the shoulders of the patient teachers, mentors and developers who believed in us and inspire us to keep building. We are humbled with the understanding that nothing is built alone.
